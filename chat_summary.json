The user responded with instructions to add the sidebar. A list of potential features followed, where the user indicated preferences for implementing a real-time blockchain news feed, live chat support, a search function, and a responsive design, among others. The AI acknowledged these implementations.\n\nSubsequently, the user asked for a navbar with the same navigation links and was again presented with two questions about the navbar's design: whether it should be fixed at the top scrolling down or disappear and reappear on scroll, along with options regarding the style of the navlinks. The user reiterated the request for the navbar.\n\nFurther discussions elicited additional features to implement, such as user authentication, interactive blockchain charts, and customizable alerts. The user also asked for a \"Submit\" button, prompting the AI to confirm its addition. The user continued to express interest in additional features like dark/light mode toggles, language selection options, and sticky header navigation, which the AI acknowledged and worked on. \n\nLastly, the AI sought more details about the project from the user, emphasizing the ongoing support in adding the requested elements.",
